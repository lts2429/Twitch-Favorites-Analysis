# Twitch-Favorites-Analysis
A brief side project analyzing broadcaster information on Twitch TV.

The code notebook "Twitch API Calls, Data Engineering Project" contains all necessary code to gather every broadcast currently streaming on Twitch TV. The data gathered is stored in a .csv file on my local machine, and the code notebook is run <i>from</i> my local machine as well. The code is executed as Python script (a .py as opposed to a .ipynb) at the top of every hour, using Windows Task Scheduler.
